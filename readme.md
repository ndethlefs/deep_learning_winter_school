# Deep Learning Winter School (at the University of Hull)


The 1st and 2nd Deep Learning Winter School took place at the University of Hull in January 2018 and 2019. They were tailored towards undergraduate and postgradudate students as well as advanced pupils and prospective students who wish to get involved with the exciting research field of deep learning. 

The 2-day events were designed as a hands-on introduction to the theory and practice of deep learning - the driving technology behind recent breakthroughs in Artificial Intelligence, such as self-diriving cars, personal assistants, autonomous drones and machine translation, amongst many others. Knowledge of deep learning and experience in applying it are increasingly sought after skills for graduates, both in industry and academia. 

This repository contains lecture slides and lab sheets, scripts and instructions, from the event, as well as tutorial materials that we used in support. The event also included a number of invited talks from academia and industry and participants had the chance to work on a project (individually in 2018, and in a group in 2019). Finally, there was an opporunity to meet Viper, the University's in-house supercomputer.
